--TODO--
 * Compress and encrypt data on transit?
 * Should I replace message id with round?
 * Implement data streams
 * Improve Data class and file storage
 
--Unit Test--
 * Slices
 * Reads
 * Quorum updates
 
 --Possible improvements--
 * Can we use a proposal for each store instead of each record?
 * Change the thread model using an asynchronous message processor? Also change the SPI to asynchronous?
 * The PNTServer propose handler accepts Quorum changes without verifying if all messages are replicated!
